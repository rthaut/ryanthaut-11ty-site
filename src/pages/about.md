## Who Am I

Eventually I will take the time to write about myself. Until then, this page is *not* about me; it's more about me not yet having written about myself.{ .lead }

### Freelance Services

#### Web Development &amp; Design

I often do both the design work for a new website, as well as the development work. Occasionally, I will only do one or the other, but I like to think of myself as a self-proclaimed web "deviner" (that’s "developer" and "designer" mashed together). I have worked with a wide variety of clients, from churches and small businesses, to enterprise-level corporations, and even the occasional adult website.

I typically build simple websites that don’t require databases, but I have worked extensively with MySQL. I avoid building custom Content Management Systems (CMS), as I find they are far too expensive for most clients, especially when free, powerful alternatives like [WordPress](http://wordpress.org/ "WordPress Official Site") exist.

#### WordPress Themes

If you read the previous paragraph, you would probably have noted that I work with [WordPress](http://wordpress.org/ "WordPress Official Site") when my clients require a Content Management System. Typically, my clients already have their content created within their own WordPress database, and they are simply looking for a "facelift" of their site.

This simply means that they need a new theme built that can display their data in a new way. I also use WordPress for my personal sites, and I try to create new themes for each of them at least once a year, both for practice and to expand my portfolio.

#### Interface Design

I seem to have done more interface design in recent years than web design, which is absolutely fine with me. I have designed the User Interfaces (UI) for several mobile applications and their corresponding widgets. I also created the interface for a [Flash](http://www.adobe.com/products/flashplayer.html "Flash Player Product Page")-based flowchart creation web application.

My first real interface design work was creating skins for the game content distribution system [Steam](http://store.steampowered.com/about "Steam Platform Information"), although regrettably I have not had the spare time to create skins for the newest version of Steam.
