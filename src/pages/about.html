                <h4>Web Development &amp; Design</h4>
                <p>I often do both the design work for a new website, as well as the development work. Occasionally, I will only do one or the other, but I like to think of myself as a self-proclaimed web "deviner" (that’s "developer" and "designer" mashed together). I have worked with a wide variety of clients, from churches and small businesses, to enterprise-level corporations, and even the occasional adult website.</p>
                <p>I typically build simple websites that don’t require databases, but I have worked extensively with MySQL. I avoid building custom Content Management Systems (CMS), as I find they are far too expensive for most clients, especially when free, powerful alternatives like <a title="WordPress Official Site" href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a> exist.</p>

                        <h4>WordPress Themes</h4>
                        <p>If you read the previous paragraph, you would probably have noted that I work with <a title="WordPress Official Site" href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a> when my clients require a Content Management System. Typically, my clients already have their content created within their own WordPress database, and they are simply looking for a "facelift" of their site.</p>
                        <p>This simply means that they need a new theme built that can display their data in a new way. I also use WordPress for my personal sites, and I try to create new themes for each of them at least once a year, both for practice and to expand my portfolio.</p>

                        <h4>Interface Design</h4>
                        <p>I seem to have done more interface design in recent years than web design, which is absolutely fine with me. I have designed the User Interfaces (UI) for several mobile applications and their corresponding widgets. I also created the interface for a <a title="Flash Player Product Page" href="http://www.adobe.com/products/flashplayer.html">Flash</a>-based flowchart creation web application.</p>
                        <p>My first real interface design work was creating skins for the game content distribution system <a title="Steam Platform Information" href="http://store.steampowered.com/about/">Steam</a>, although regrettably I have not had the spare time to create skins for the newest version of Steam.</p>
