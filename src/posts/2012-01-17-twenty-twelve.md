That just rolls off the tongue, doesn't it? Not like 2011, which often came out as "twen'y 'leven" if you were unwilling to take the time to say "two thousand eleven." Say it one more time, now that you are thinking about your enunciation: 2012.

Despite that heart-warming moment we just shared, I am not writing a post solely on how easy it is to say 2012. I actually set out to write my first actual blog post, ever; it just so happens that this is also my first post of the year 2012, hence the title. It feels good to be writing something, but I am already feeling slightly overwhelmed. It's not so much the act of writing; it's actually just the idea that I need to organize my thoughts. Typically myÂ thought process is chaotic at best, so I imagine my first few posts will seem at least slightly scatter-brained. I think most people's thought process is that way, but they either don't admit it, or they don't realize it.

I am not here to write about my plans, hopes, dreams, or wishes for the coming year. It's not that I don't like thinking about the future; I simply don't (think about the future). For instance, I despise the common interview question, "Where do you see yourself in 5 years?" Honestly, I would like to see myself successfully employed in an enjoyable career that is both challenging and rewarding. For some reason, though, interviewers don't like that answer. They want to see if you are gunning for management, or if you intend to move on after a year or two, so that answer does not help them at all.

That seems to be everything I have to say on the subject of 2012, for now. I will leave you with a spoiler, though: I plan to write a post (as well as update my status on various social networks) on December 22, 2012, when we are all... still here.
